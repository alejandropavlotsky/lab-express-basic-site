                Rick Gervais has had a relationship with author and producer Jane Fallon since the 1980s. He says they
                have not been married because "it makes no sense for us to have a true ceremony in the eyes of God since
                there is no God" and that They have had children because "we can't imagine spending 16 years of our
                lives. And there are too many children, of course"
            </p>
            <p>
                Gervais is a strong advocate for the rights of LGBT people (lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans) and has
                praised the legalization of same-sex marriage in England and Wales as "a victory for all of us" and
                declared "anything that promotes equality, promotes progress. " He added: "You can't take equality 'too
                far.'"
            </p> 
            <p>
                Ricky Gervais confessed that he became an atheist when he was 8 years old.1 He is a fervent defender of
                animal rights, even writing to Gordon Brown to stop using black bearskin as clothing for the guards.
