                In 1983, during his final year as a student at University College London, Gervais and college friend
                Bill Macrae formed the new wave pop duo Seona Dancing. They were signed by London Records, which
                released two of their singles—"More to Lose" and "Bitter Heart". The songs failed to chart inside the UK
                top 75. Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in the
                Philippines with "More to Lose". He also worked as the manager for Suede before they became
                successful in the 1990s.

                In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as David Brent along with a band under the name "Foregone
                Conclusion". Gervais and the band performed songs written under the Brent character including songs such
                as "Equality Street" and "Free Love Freeway". Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos under
                the title 'Learn Guitar with David Brent', featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.
            </p>
            <p>

                In 2016, as part of the Life on Road film promotion, Gervais published the David Brent Songbook
                containing 15 songs. These were also recorded for the album Life on the Road, under the name of David
                Brent and Foregone Conclusion.

                Gervais worked as an assistant events manager for the University of London Union (ULU), then
                moved from ULU to a job as head of speech at the alternative radio station Xfm. Needing an
                assistant, Gervais interviewed the first person whose curriculum vitae he saw. It belonged to
                Stephen Merchant. In 1998 Gervais was made redundant when the station was taken over by the
                Capital Radio group. Around this time he was also a regular contributor to Mary Anne Hobbs's
                Radio 1 show, performing vox pop interviews in unlikely locations.

            <p>

                After the first series of The Office, Gervais and Merchant returned to Xfm in November 2001 for a
                Saturday radio show as conquering heroes. This was when the pair first worked with Karl
                Pilkington, who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of
                podcasts.

            In October 2017, Gervais began hosting the weekly radio show Ricky Gervais Is Deadly Sirius on
            Sirius XM.

            <h4>
                The Office
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Office started when Stephen Merchant, while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short
                film.
                In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from Ash Atalla, who was shown a
                7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss'. Thus David Brent was created. Merchant passed this tape on to
                the
                BBC's Head of Entertainment Paul Jackson at the Edinburgh Fringe, who then passed it on to Head of
                Comedy
                Jon Plowman, who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.

            </p>
            <p>
                The first six-episode series of The Office aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or
                attention. Word-of-mouth, repeats, and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and
                anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes. Following the success of The Office's
                second series, Gervais was named the most powerful person in TV comedy by Radio Times.

            <h4>
                Extras
            </h4>
            <p>
                Extras had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the
                sitcom
                ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a background artist. Millman is more
                self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais's The Office character David Brent. Guest stars on
                the
                first series of Extras include Ross Kemp, Les Dennis, Patrick Stewart, Vinnie Jones, Samuel L. Jackson,
                Ben
                Stiller, Kate Winslet and Francesca Martinez. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and
                featured appearances by Daniel Radcliffe, Dame Diana Rigg, Orlando Bloom, Sir Ian McKellen, Chris
                Martin,
                Keith Chegwin, Robert Lindsay, Warwick Davis, Ronnie Corbett, Stephen Fry, Richard Briers, Patricia
                Potter,
                Sophia Myles, Moira Stuart, David Bowie, Robert De Niro and Jonathan Ross.

            <h4>
                An Idiot Abroad
            </h4>
            <p>
                An Idiot Abroad is a travel documentary produced by Gervais and Merchant where a reluctant Pilkington
                travels around the world, with his reactions to people and places recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and
                Merchant call to surprise him with a new place to visit or task to do. Pilkington reports back mostly
                complaining about the situation. Gervais says there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend
                around
                filming for many hours - which Gervais edits down to an hour each episode.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two series and a Christmas special have aired; series one involves Pilkington visiting the Seven Wonders
                of
                the World. In the second show he chooses to complete tasks from a bucket list provided by Gervais and in
                the special Warwick Davis joins Pilkington on a journey following Marco Polo's route from Italy to
                China.

            <h4>
                After Life
            </h4>
            <p>
                On 9 May 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given a production order for the first season of the
                comedy-drama After Life. The series was created and directed by Gervais who is also set to star and
                executive produce alongside Charlie Hanson. On 14 January 2019, it was announced that the
                series would premiere on 8 March 2019. It was further announced that Duncan Hayes would serve as an
                additional executive producer and that Hanson would actually serve as a producer. On 3 April 2019,
                Netflix renewed the series for a second season.

                Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s; his first successful show took place at the Cafe
                Royal, as part of the 2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Titled Rubbernecker, the show also featured Jimmy
                Carr, Robin Ince and Stephen Merchant.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gervais later toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show Animals. The Politics tour followed a year
                later. Both of these shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of
                the themed live trilogy, Fame, took place in 2007. It started in Glasgow in January and ended in
                Sheffield in April. Blackpool reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on
                sale.

            <p>
                Gervais performing in 2007
                Newsnight Review's panel saw Animals during its Bloomsbury run and covered it in January 2003. They were
                not favourable, with Private Eye editor Ian Hislop saying it was "cobbled together ... banal ... a bit
                flat". After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an "ugly little pug-faced
                cunt".
            </p>

            <p>
                Fame was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais told a story, ostensibly about how
                people will do anything to become famous, referring to the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gervais's fourth show was entitled Science, and commenced with an eleven-date tour in August 2009 at the
                Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow. The DVD for Science was released on 15
                November 2010.
            </p>

            <p>
                In November 2009, he headlined the sixth annual New York Comedy Festival at Carnegie Hall.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2013, Gervais announced that his next stand-up show would be called Humanity. In December 2014,
                he said he was too busy to do this tour due to producing two films.
            </p>


            <p>
                In May 2016, Gervais was back doing stand-up in London, starting with some low key warm-ups with cast
                members from Derek. He said, "Finally, I'm going to do some stand-up. The first in about six years
                if you don't count hosting the Golden Globes".
            </p>

            <p>
                He continued his Humanity show throughout 2017 and into 2018; appearing at SF Sketchfest as part of the
                tour, which devoted a night in honor of the comedian, alongside comedic legend and mentor Christopher
                Guest.
            </p>


            <p>
                His next tour and Netflix special SuperNature was announced in late 2018, where Gervais warned people
                not to travel to see “work in progress” as it would be a “shambles”. The SuperNature shows continued
                through 2019 and 2020.
